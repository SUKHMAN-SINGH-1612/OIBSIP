# Car Price Prediction

Predicting the selling price of used cars is a challenging yet essential task. This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the selling price of cars based on various features. The dataset includes details such as car name, manufacturing year, selling price, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, selling type, transmission, and the number of previous owners.

### Dataset Columns

| Column Name     | Description                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Car_Name        | The name or model of the car.                     |
| Year            | The manufacturing year of the car.                |
| Selling_Price   | The selling price of the car (target variable).   |
| Present_Price   | The current market price of the car.              |
| Driven_kms      | The number of kilometers the car has been driven. |
| Fuel_Type       | The type of fuel the car uses (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, CNG). |
| Selling_Type    | The method of selling the car (e.g., Dealer, Individual). |
| Transmission    | The type of transmission in the car (e.g., Manual, Automatic). |
| Owner           | The number of previous owners of the car.         |

### Goal

The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the selling price of a used car based on its various attributes. By leveraging the information provided in the dataset, the model aims to assist potential buyers and sellers in estimating a fair selling price for a given car.

### Approach

The project involves exploratory data analysis to understand the relationships between different features and the target variable. Feature engineering may be applied to enhance the model's predictive capabilities. Various regression algorithms will be implemented and evaluated to determine the most effective model for this specific car price prediction task.
