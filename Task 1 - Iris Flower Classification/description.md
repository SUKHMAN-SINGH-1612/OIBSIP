# Iris Flower Classification

### Task 1

Iris flowers are known to have three distinct species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, each characterized by unique measurements. In this project, you are presented with a dataset containing measurements of iris flowers based on their respective species. Your mission is to build a machine learning model capable of learning from these measurements and accurately classifying the iris flowers into their correct species.

### Data Dictionary

Here's a brief description of the dataset columns:

| Column Name  | Description                         |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| id           | Unique identifier for each flower  |
| sepal_length | Length of the sepal                |
| sepal_width  | Width of the sepal                 |
| petal_length | Length of the petal                |
| petal_width  | Width of the petal                 |
| species      | Species of the flower              |

### Insights

From our exploratory data analysis, we have discovered that the sepal and petal lengths and widths are the most crucial features for distinguishing between the different iris species. Notably, the virginica species exhibits the highest petal length-width and sepal length among the three species.

### Model Performance

After implementing and evaluating various machine learning models, the K Nearest Neighbors Classifier demonstrated exceptional performance with an accuracy of 97.78%. This model's capability to correctly classify iris flowers based on their measurements makes it a strong choice for this classification task.

This project not only showcases the process of building a machine learning model for iris flower classification but also highlights the importance of exploratory data analysis in understanding the dataset and selecting the most appropriate model for the task.
